### 👋

👉 Estaba en Bluesky y he visto que se podían usar dominios propios para el handle.

👉 He entrado en GoDaddy y he visto que el aabilio.me estaba regalado. Y me lo he comprado 🤷‍♂️.

👉 Después de usarlo como nombre para menciones en la red social, he pensado que alguien podría entrar a curiosear.

👉 Así que con GitHub pages me creé esta página. Y he asociado el nuevo dominio comprado a la misma.

Y esta es mi historia Patricia 📺.
